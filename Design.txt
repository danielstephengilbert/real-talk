Top-Level Ideas and Design Considerations...

- Build this whole thing from scratch so that I know the supply chain
  is not compromised!

- Still need to trust the C compiler and libraries used.
  - Think of a clever way to verify that none of that is invalid.
    - E.g., When code compiles, always compare compiler and all dependencies
      to currently used versions and hashes.
    - Manually update the hashes when updating the local supply chain components.
    - And remember, all this is useless if the operating system, or layers
      beneath the application are compromised.

- In addition, there could be network compromise,
  but if everything is done right, that would depend on breaking the encryption.
  - Need to protect against quantum.

Usage Ideas (these will evolve as I build this out...)

server: rt -s ip port
client: rt -c ip port

In both cases, ctrl+c should terminate the program and all related connections.
